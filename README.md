Create back-end on Go for https://asperitas.vercel.app/ (redditclone). Front was written and I had to write back-end. Users and sessions store in MySqldb, posts store in Mongodb. There are tests for users's and posts's handlers and for users's and posts's repositories. You can run this by go run main.go from cmd/redditclone.
